{"name":"Minigrace","tagline":"Self-hosting compiler for the Grace programming language","body":"Minigrace\r\n=========\r\n_Minigrace_ is a compiler for the Grace programming language.\r\n\r\nMinigrace compiles Grace to native code via C, and to JavaScript. The compiler is written in\r\nGrace itself. It supports most of the specified language to date: for\r\ndetails on current language feature support see <doc/errata>.\r\n\r\nMinigrace should work on POSIX-compliant systems, and is known to work\r\non Linux, NetBSD, and Mac OS X.  Native code generation requires a properly-configured GCC on\r\nthe path, which may require installing development tools.  Running the generated JavaScript requires\r\nthat _node.js_ be installed.\r\n\r\nTarball distributions should compile with just `./configure && make`.\r\nMore detailed build instructions\r\nare in <doc/build>.\r\n\r\nAfter building there will be a `minigrace` executable in the root directory. This\r\nexecutable supports a few different modes and options, described in\r\n<doc/usage>. The simplest usage is just:\r\n    ./minigrace file.grace\r\nwhich will compile _file.grace_ to a native executable and then run it, and\r\n    ./minigrace --target js file.grace\r\nwhich will _compile file.grace_ to JavaScript and then execute it with node.\r\n\r\nThe Minigrace documentation is listed in the <doc/index> file.\r\n\r\nLicensing\r\n---------\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
