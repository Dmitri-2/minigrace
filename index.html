<p><em>Minigrace</em> is a compiler for the Grace programming language.</p>

<p>Minigrace compiles Grace to native code via C, and to JavaScript. The compiler is written in
Grace itself. It supports most of the specified language to date: for
details on current language feature support see .</p>

<p>Minigrace should work on POSIX-compliant systems, and is known to work
on Linux, NetBSD, and Mac OS X.  Native code generation requires a properly-configured GCC on
the path, which may require installing development tools.  Running the generated JavaScript requires
that <em>node.js</em> be installed.</p>

<p>Tarball distributions should compile with just <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make</code>.
More detailed build instructions
are in .</p>

<p>After building there will be a <code>minigrace</code> executable in the root directory. This
executable supports a few different modes and options, described in
. The simplest usage is just:
    ./minigrace file.grace
which will compile <em>file.grace</em> to a native executable and then run it, and
    ./minigrace --target js file.grace
which will <em>compile file.grace</em> to JavaScript and then execute it with node.</p>

<p>The Minigrace documentation is listed in the  file.</p>
