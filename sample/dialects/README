To use a dialect with the C backend, it must be compiled as a 
dynamic module.  This is so that it can be linked into the compiler at
compile time.  As of August 2015, both dynamic and static modules are
generated at every compile.

A makefile is provided to build all of the example dialects. Dynamic
modules are not currently supported under Cygwin.

After building the dialect module, another module can use the dialect
when compiled in the ordinary fashion. Some simple example users of the
dialects are included.

All of these examples are compiled with the web-based JavaScript
compiler.  They can be used without further effort.
